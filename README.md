# RiceLeafDiseaseDetection
🔍 Project Overview

This project aims to automate the detection and classification of common rice leaf diseases — **Leaf Smut**, **Brown Spot**, and **Bacterial Leaf Blight** — using image-based deep learning. Early detection of these diseases is crucial to minimize crop damage and ensure food security.

🎯 Objectives

- 🔬 Detect and classify rice leaf diseases using a CNN-based model.
- 📊 Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- 🖼️ Work with real-world image data from UCI repository/Kaggle.

🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras
- NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
- Google Colab (for training)
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)
- GitHub (project version control)

Future Work

- Expand dataset with more classes and images.
- Deploy on edge devices (Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano).
- Build web/mobile interface for farmers.
